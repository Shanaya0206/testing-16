Introduction  

I have created a Native android application on Android Studio using the language Kotlin to create a solution to the scenario given. The application will make use of if statements. An if statement is an important control structure in programming that enables you to implement code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false and is utilized to make decisions and control the overall execution of your program. This application will also make use of the comments to provide explanations for the source code to guide and assist humans in understanding the code and make it easier to maintain. I have also mentioned the design process and the use of GitHub. I have also included screenshots of my code and included the emulator that shows you how my application runs.  

  

The Purpose of the App 

The purpose of my app is to assist my friend Hera in choosing meals based on the time of day because she is unable to do so based on her busy schedule. I have created a fun and simple app that helps her decide what to eat based on whether it is Morning, Afternoon, or Night. I hope I can help her in the most effective way possible. 

The Design Considerations 

I am required to use if statements to successfully implement suggestions that hopefully assist Hera . However, I first needed to design the UI (User Interface ). This will be the actual layout of my app where Hera will input all the values necessary and, in return, receive an output. I used a plain text where she input the time of day and I used a text view where the results will displayed. I also made use of 2 buttons, 1 that computes everything when she clicks it to display results. The second button will reset and clear the input she has typed. 

The next step was to compile the code and logic. I used the main activity to declare my variables and to assign values to my variables. I declared a button that will compute the suggestions by assigning the specific values depending on the time of day entered. I also created an if statement that will handle errors such as an invalid input. I declared the button the button to reset input information. Once I completed the code I ran the app on the emulator to see if it runs or crashes. 

 

 

 

The Utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions 

GitHub is a remarkable tool for developers to collaborate effectively, maintain version control, and even showcase their work to a wider community. It is a combination of Gits capabilities and GitHub’s intuitive truly empowers teams to work on their projects with precise and synergy. Due to Git Hub's capabilities, I am required to use it to conduct manual testing to ensure the app functions seamlessly.
